				<p>I haven’t blogged in almost 2 years, but I’ve just taken part in one of the most amazing experiences of my life; a ~190 mile cycle ride through Sierra Leone and Liberia, something I want to share.</p>

<p>We cycled over newly built Chinese funded roads, up and down muddy rollers, through rural DFID supported villages big and small, over EU funded bridges and via Street Child supported projects; all whilst traversing West Africa’s lush green scenery and under it’s sticky humidity and unforgiving weather (May is the start of the rainy season!). All in aid of supporting the great work Street Child do (it’s not too late to donate here!).</p>

<p>I arrived in Sierra Leone a couple of days early to catch up with a few old friends and see how Freetown has changed since my last visit, but I’ll skip that and jump straight to the start of the challenge itself.</p>

<h2 id="day-one">Day One</h2>
<p>I met up with a Street Child rep outside Lungi airport to wait for the arrival of the rest of the group that I’d be spending the next week and a bit cycling through West Africa with; 2 students, a Marketing Manager, an EU diplomat and a property developer along with a Medic who’d be joining us in a supporting a car with 4 Street Child reps. After seeing a group of confused looking westerners with cycle helmets strapped to their bags we walked over and introduced ourselves, we took a bit of time to sort out money changing and simcards before we headed over to a car which would take us on the 4 hour drive along a newly Chinese built tarmac road to Bo. The car was a standard West African vehicle; battered, ripped interior and no working air con; a sticky journey indeed! Along the way we stopped at a junction where we had a stock reminder that we were in 3rd world country; during the stop a bag from our group was stolen and after reporting it to the local chief and police a  crowd started to gather around our vehicle, before anything could escalate we jumped back into the car and sped back off on our way to Bo, where we’d be staying for the first night.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later we arrived in a somewhat damp and old looking Hotel  where the rooms had a stale putrid smell, the ‘receptionist’ was  not pleased to see us, and the rooms barley ready for anyone to sleep in - doors on their hinges, power which lasted all of 2 hours a ‘bathroom’ which doesn’t even bare mentioning; welcome to West Africa! After a stuffy night, we awoke to a breakfast consisting of 1 bread roll and a hardboiled egg…yummy.</p>

<p>Today we visited a school a couple of miles out from the hotel where Street Child support a couple of children, the school was a structure built of local wood and second hand corrigated iron consisting of 6 classrooms holding 402 children and 7 teachers who haven’t received a salary for over 6 months. After disrupting the, by now, hyperactive children we walked around the local area to visit the market and meet some of the local traders which Street Child support, one selling local chillies and saving 5,000 leones (50p) a week via Street Child for her future and another who have set up a stall selling biscuits, toothpaste and cigarettes so they can afford to send their child to school (which costs £30 a year).</p>

<p>After lunch, we headed to Street Child’s compound in Bo to get fitted up on our bikes (Mine was called ‘Big Boss’) and get a briefing on what the next few days would look like. Following this we went over to meet the Sports Minister in Bo’s Chinese funded Football stadium; a vast building which is rarely used as the local people need to ‘rent’ it out from the Chinese to use it, but the cost to rent is unaffordable and thus this building just stands there rusting, unused.</p>

<p>Time for some sleep, so we headed back to a hotel for a good rest before the start of the cycle ride….at this point, it became apparent that we got dropped off at the wrong hotel the night before (doh!) so a quick swap of hotels, a tasty dinner of chicken and rice followed by sleep.</p>

<h2 id="day-two">Day Two</h2>
<p>The ride starts; we started peddling at 7am from a local petrol station, waved off by the sports minister and preceded by a police escort on a motorbike to guide us through the busy roads of Bo. After a couple of miles we’re on our own; cycling through the lush green country side of Sierra Leone, trees as tall as houses and as old as some of the remains in London, past palm and mango trees and over rivers covered in lilies. Every couple of miles we cycled through a village with the children coming running out of their huts waving and shouting ‘Pomwi, Pomwi!’; White Man in Mendi, the related tribes in south Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>We stopped below a mango tree in a village called Futapeje for lunch, where two local Sierra Leonians who set up ahead of us cooked groundnut stew, chicken and rice for lunch - just what’s needed to fill a, by now, very hungry stomach!</p>

<p>After lunch we hit red dusty roads, with rollers up and down along an unbuilt road with the sun pounding down on us and the humidity hitting 96%…starting to wish I hadn’t eaten so much for lunch now! By 15:00 we had reached our finial point of the day, slightly ahead of schedule. The village was called Portoru, and, as is customary in Sierra Leone, we had an audience with the local chief where we handed over some gifts for the local children; footballs and supplies for the school - we then heard from some of the local girls who are beneficiaries of Street Child - allowing them to go to School. One of the local girls travelled 12 miles to get to school and used to sleep rough during the weeks so she could attend and return home during the weekends; unfortunately one night this poor girl was raped whilst sleeping out on the streets - now, thanks to the support of Street Child, she stays with a local family in the village during the week so she can attend her lessons.</p>

<p>That night was spent in the local community hut, sleeping on foam matts under mosquito nets top and tailing it in twos. Some blue tarpaulin was put up outside to provide some privacy whilst we bucket showered away the red muck that had stuck to us from the days cycle. A generator had been switched on in a local shop over the road when we arrived, which meant one thing….a cold Star beer…result. The night was spent playing cards on the patio and observing the bright moon lighting up the jungle canopies around us.</p>

<h2 id="day-three">Day Three</h2>
<p>Tough. Really tough.</p>

<p>Day three was a solid 70 miles, up at 05:30 and setting off as early as possible so as to miss the midday heat. The morning was really hard; hills, hills and more hills. You force yourself up one hill, gasping for air whilst the lactic acid is building up in your legs to get to the top to only see you go back down and then up another one. There is no shade, the equatorial sun is inescapable at 28c and the humidity almost hitting around 96%. A sigh of relief, we finally hit the river Mauh where a hand pulled ferry made from local wood takes us across. A local lady is selling coconuts for 2,000 leones (20p) which provides some much needed refreshment.</p>

<p>At the other side of the river we continue along much the same terrain until we hit a police check point at Zimmi, where we take a quick break whilst we sought permission to cycle through. By now the road was less wide, so we could cycle between the shade of the trees until we hit Nigmahurn where we stopped for lunch. Today’s lunch was spicy, a tad too spicy for my English tastebuds, but I still wolfed as much as I could down me. By now, some of the group started to get the West African stomach….quick, get the antibacterial hand wash!</p>

<p>We continued on to the village of Fario where we had a sitting with the Chief to provide some more gifts to the local village children. This chief was a character; 70ish years of age dressed in an elaborate red and gold outfit swinging back and forth in a hammock….at the end of the sitting he proposed to one of the Street Child reps and invited all of us to the wedding! Back on the bikes and along a trail through the jungle until we hit rocky sand. For those that have never cycled through sand, I can advise you not to try it. It is hard; you slip, you fall, you bruise, it hurts - simple as that.  After a very long 2 hours of struggling and lots of bumps and cuts we finally arrived in our destination; Sulima. By the time we arrive almost half the group have a bad stomach, every one is shattered from the long day and dehydration is kicking in, but before we can head to bed we have to meet the Chief and handover some gifts. We were shown the beach…beautiful yellow sandy beaches for as far as the eye can see, with the crashing of waves and a backdrop of green jungles. Unfortunately the beach is littered in plastic rubbish washed up from the sea, and empty boxes of American Opiet drugs; since the war there has been a flood of cheap American Opiets in Sierra Leone, making addiction common among many in larger communities.</p>

<p>Tonight we stayed in a local guest house, which meant we each had our own room and a bed along with a few hours of power and a flushing (a rarity out here!) toilet - it was pure luxury. Before we retired for bed we had time for a nice cold beer and a tasty dinner; fish and rice. By the end of the day we had assented 4,653ft!</p>

<h2 id="day-four">Day Four</h2>
<p>Day four was, distance wise, easy as we had to allow for plenty of time to cross the Liberian border - but as with every day, we had our challenges.</p>

<p>We set off back along sandy track for a couple of hours of more falls and bruises - falling into a muddy puddle full of rocks is really not a nice feeling! 
We stopped at another school which Street Child helps out, where we played a bit of football in the scorching sun and met the kids and teachers. The headteacher was an agricultural man from the North of Sierra Leone who visited the village a couple of years ago and saw there was no local school, so he set one up and has been teaching there ever since….as a volunteer, completely unpaid - he teaches 80 children 5 days week.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours we hit a junction where we sought cover from the sun under a stand with the local Chief, one of the members of the group had gone down with really bad dehydration and the medic had to rehydrate them via an intravenous drip; how she managed to stay so cool is a testament to her professionalism. In the middle of Sierra Leone, with about 60 kids shouting and pushing around our support car whist she calmly inserted an IV drip - amazing work, but another realisation to the rest of us that we really are in the remote areas of West Africa; days away from the nearest hospital.</p>

<p>Whilst this was going on, we’re being told a story by a local man about how a Lady had had her bags stolen in a village not far from here; she went to the Chief and Police to try and get it back but they denied all knowledge of it. She then went and saw the local Medicine man (Witch Doctor) to punish the people who stole her bag, the medicine man then put a curse on anyone in that village who had touched any of her belongs. A few weeks later 12 of the villagers died. These stories are common out here, and it’s been known for some Witch Doctors to poison people they have put ‘curses’ on so as to keep up the perception of their ‘powers’.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours the person started to regain some colour and had stabilised so (with them staying in the car!) we got back on our bikes and headed to the border; a surprisingly dusty and ill maintained route.</p>

<p>Once at the border we all had to, one by one, go and see the immigration officer in Sierra Leone to get our exit stamps which took a good couple of hours as the EU diplomat had two passports; and had their entrance stamps in one and visa for Liberia in another….a bit of a no no. After a bit of back and forth from a Street Child rep, it was finally agreed that they could purchased another visa to go into the stamped passport and all would be good.</p>

<p>Liberia!!! Almost…….</p>

<p>At the border there is a log book where passport numbers and Yellow Fever Certifications and written down, which is done manually by pen and paper. The chap on the border today was clearly not in the mood to write out 12 people’s details and was keen to come to ‘some other arrangement’ to allow us to continue.</p>

<p>After crossing a bridge over the river Mano into Liberia we then had to wait a few more hours whilst our passports where checked by the Liberian authorities, by this point we are all starving - it’s about 14:30 in the afternoon - thankfully the Liberian authorities allow us to go an wait in a local restaurant, where we have what was probably the most disgusting food of the trip - a spicy slush of casava leaves and over cooked rice.</p>

<p>By 16:00 we were allowed through, but the heavens had opened and the most almighty rain was pounding down on us as we slogged it through the next 2 hours of cycling.</p>

<p>Just before dark we had hit our finial destination, Sinje. By now the fatigue had really kicked in all we wanted to do was sleep. Tonight’s accommodation was a guest house in Sinje where each room was lit like a brothel in Amsterdam; bright red neon like lights with a very loud disco going on outside. Behind us on a hill, its silhouette against the dark grey clouds, was an Ebola Clinic…8 large constructed tents, a water tower, and 20 feet barbed wire fences surrounding it; I spoke to some locals about it who preferred not to discuss it, but one person told me ‘it’s where they went to die’. It’s placement on a hill overlooking the entire town acts a dark reminder of the devastating impact Ebola had in this part of the world.</p>

<h2 id="day-five">Day Five</h2>
<p>The finial hurrah to Robertsport, but by now all bar 2 in the group had gone down ill and the person from yesterday was put in another car and sent to a hospital in Monrovia as his condition and deteriorated in the night.</p>

<p>The first couple of hours were nice and flat, along tarmac roads where you could get a good pace up; I put my headphones in and played some upbeat music to keep a good rhythm going. We stopped at at a School called Tombey Public School which Street Child runs; in 2014 25,000 Children across Liberia sat their year 12 exams which would get them into University…not one person passed. As you can imagine, this kicked the Government into action so they started a scheme to outsource all of their schools for 3 years to 7 organisations (a mix of NGO’s and for profit) with the view of learning how best to run schools and bring them back in house. Street Child is one of the 7, and after their first year of running some schools they had achieved an 11% uplift in exam results compared to the year before. The scheme is due to expire next year, so it’ll be interesting to see what the outcome is.</p>

<p>After visiting the school we were back on our bikes for the finial 30 miles…but my god it was long and tough, with three HUGE hills to climb along the way. Lunch consisted of sardines and local cucumber in rolls, it filled a gap. As we got closer to the finish it became harder…the sun was scorching, the muddy and bumpy roads never ending and energy levels at an all time low…we passed circumnavigated a huge lake, passed a Liberian prison until a sign….’Robertsport’…we’d made it!! Well, that was until we discovered there was a 500metre, 17% incline hill to climb. Bugger.</p>

<p>We approached the hill as a team, and tackled it together - legs burning, hands blistered, lungs tight, bum’s so sore you could barely sit on the seat -cheering and pushing each other along ensuring that everyone one of us in the group crossed that line on their bike, together. Done, complete, finished.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The End…</h2>
<p>This trip was one of the most amazing experiences, and up their with the hardest challenges I’ve ever done. It was mentally draining, thought provoking - shocking at times - and physically challenging.  Seeing the great work charities like Street Child do in these hard to reach places, and hearing stories that are unimaginable to most people in the west: the horrific history of the Civil War; Parents being shot in front of Children, 13 year old boys being forced to mutilate others - through to FGM and rape on girls as young as 5, the teenage prostitution and the addictions to cheap over the counter drugs and, more recently, the Ebola outbreak. The large swathes of people thrust back into poverty due to European mining companies pulling out, and the sudden influx of Chinese workers building infrastructure in return for debts which will cripple any future potential economic growth.</p>

<p>Almost everyone I spoke to had some story to tell, lost someone close in either the civil war or Ebola, knew but didn’t speak, of FGM, rape and drug addiction.  The people I met have been through more than most people could even think possible. Yet their persistence to better themselves, to move on from the past peacefully,  their desire to help in anyway they can; by teaching for free, or giving some food and water to a stupid cyclist. Their lust for education and employment opportunities is truly a sight to see, which words nor pictures can do no justice.</p>
